    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>MacExplorer ("the App") is developed and maintained by Turina Technologies. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>MacExplorer does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. The App operates entirely on your local device and does not communicate with any external servers or third-party services.</p>

    <h2>2. File System Access</h2>
    <p>MacExplorer accesses your file system solely to provide its core functionality — browsing, navigating, and managing files and folders on your Mac. All file operations are performed locally on your device. No file names, paths, or contents are ever transmitted outside your device.</p>

    <h2>3. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>The App does not use any analytics tools, crash reporting services, advertising SDKs, or any other form of tracking technology. We do not know how you use the App.</p>

    <h2>4. No Account Required</h2>
    <p>MacExplorer does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the App.</p>

    <h2>5. No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or cloud platforms. No data is shared with any third party under any circumstances.</p>

    <h2>6. App Sandbox</h2>
    <p>MacExplorer runs in Apple's App Sandbox environment. It only accesses files and folders that you explicitly navigate to within the App, in accordance with macOS security policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MacExplorer does not collect any data from any users, including children under the age of 13. The App is fully compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
